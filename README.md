# InkyWHAT_Dashboard

![alt text](https://github.com/UnfinishedStuff/InkyWHAT_Dashboard/blob/main/InkyWHAT_Dashboard.jpg?raw=true "InkyWHAT_Dashboard")

This repo contains a python file, `InkyWHAT_Dashboard.py`, which uses Selenium to scrape data from websites and show it on a Pimoroni [7" Inky Impression](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-impression-5-7?variant=32298701324371) (so, uh, I guess the repo is a misnomer..).  This project is very unfinished and hard-coded, so this is really just here as a backup of the script rather than something I'd suggest you try right now.
